# AirAware
Weather prediction project
Project Title: AirAware: A Pollution Prediction System

Introduction:
Air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges impacting public health and climate worldwide. AirAware is a smart pollution prediction system developed to forecast air quality levels in advance. The aim of this project is to create awareness and support proactive decision-making by predicting air pollution trends using machine learning techniques.

Objectives:

To collect and analyze historical air quality and weather data.

To build an accurate predictive model for forecasting Air Quality Index (AQI).

To visualize predictions for better understanding and usability.

To provide an early warning system that helps reduce exposure to harmful pollutants.


Methodology:
The project begins with data collection from reliable sources such as government AQI databases or open APIs. The dataset includes key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, along with meteorological parameters like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. After preprocessing and feature selection, machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM are trained and tested. The final model is used to predict future air quality levels.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM (based on use case)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Platform (optional): Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


Conclusion:
AirAware aims to be a useful tool for individuals, communities, and authorities by offering insights into upcoming pollution trends. With accurate forecasting, it helps promote cleaner environments and informed lifestyle decisions, contributing to healthier living and environmental sustainability.
